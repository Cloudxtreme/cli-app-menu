#: +----------------------------------------+
#:
#: Script cli-app-menu.sh is a menu of CLI applications and commands
#: to help CLI newbies to discover what a command line can do.
#:
#: Start by downloading cli-app-menu.sh, EDIT_HISTORY, COPYING, README,
#: LIST_APPS, lib_cli-common.lib, and lib_cli-menu-cat.lib.
#:
#: Then download optional modules as needed when you run the script:
#: # bash cli-app-menu.sh
#: You will be asked if you want to download additional modules (files)
#: that contain sub-menus for more CLI applications.
#:
#: Any unneeded module files, mod_apps-*.lib may be deleted at any time.
#:
#: File naming convention for archiving:
#: $THIS_FILE_<YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM>.sh
#:
#:
#: +----------------------------------------+
#: | FILE LOCATIONS of cli-app-menu project |
#: +----------------------------------------+
#:
#: The following files must be in the same folder/directory.
#: cli-app-menu.sh, EDIT_HISTORY, COPYING, README, LIST_APPS,
#: lib_cli-common.lib, and lib_cli-menu-cat.lib.
#: 
#: Specify the folder/directory where the script and module library files
#: reside by setting $THIS_DIR variable within function f_initvars_menu_app
#: in the script file, cli-app-menu.sh.
#:
#: The folder/directory must have owner read/write/execute permissions.
#: A sub-directory under the user's home directory is sufficient for this
#: purpose, such as "/home/<username goes here>/bin/cli-app-menu".
#:
#: The owner should have write access to update the files EDIT_HISTORY and
#: APP_LIST and be able to download new module library files into the folder
#: along with deleting any unneeded module library files.
#: 
#: Append the directory name to your environment $PATH:
#: Edit your /home/<username goes here>/.bashrc file and add the directory by
#: adding the lines to the end of the .bashrc file,
#:                   PATH=$PATH:~/bin/cli-app-menu
#:                   export PATH
#:
#: When cli-app-menu.sh is run i.e. "bash cli-app-menu.sh",
#: then you can download selected module files, "mod_apps-*.lib."
#: The module files contain sub-menus of various applications.
#: A list of applications is in LIST_APPS.
#:
#: You may download all or as few module files as you wish.
#: You may delete any module files that you do not need.
#:
#:
#: +----------------------------------------+
#: |        HOW-TO Update this script       |
#: +----------------------------------------+
#:
#: After each edit made, update the version (date stamp string) of each affected
#: file along with the EDIT_HISTORY file which contains the project rev date.
#: Also update the edit history text in the EDIT_HISTORY file.
#:
#:
#: +----------------------------------------+
#: |    Revision number and Revision Date   |
#: +----------------------------------------+
#:
#: Calculate revision number by counting all lines starting with "## 2013".
#: grep ^ (carot sign) means grep any lines beginning with "##2013".
#: grep -c means count the lines that match the pattern.
#:
#:REVISION=$(grep ^"## 2013" -c EDIT_HISTORY) ; REVISION="2013.$REVISION"
#:REVDATE="September-25-2013 00:28"

#: +----------------------------------------+
#: |      Why did I write this script?      |
#: +----------------------------------------+
#:
#: I wrote this script for 3 reasons:
#: 1. I wanted a categorized list of command line applications.
#: 2. I wanted to learn bash scripting, i.e. functions, looping, tests.
#: 3. I couldn't find a cli menu to launch cli apps on the web so I thought I'd
#:   give back to the community and perhaps others could build on and improve on
#:   what I've started.
#:

#:
#:
#: +----------------------------------------+
#: |      Why is this menu so complex?      |
#: +----------------------------------------+
#:
#: *The menus are designed to be quite extensible and are easily edited.
#:
#: *Menu item choices are added with a simple comment line.
#:
#: *The case pattern statements do not need a manually edited numeric pattern
#:  because menu item choices are numerically matched automatically
#:  by the use of an array generated from the menu item comment lines.
#:
#: Why not use the select command? Why not be a lazier pattern matcher?
#:
#: *I used to be a MUMPS programmer and QA analyst.
#:
#: *I used to create menus in this style in MUMPS and being a QA person, my job
#:  was to try to break programs. So that's why I tried to make pattern matching
#:  so robust rather than use wild-cards.
#:
#:       Update: Now instead of case statements, I am using wild-cards with this
#:               expression that I found when searching the internet.
#:
#:       i.e. "nslookup" contains "nsl"*.
#:       [[ "$MENU_ITEM_NAME" == "$MENU_ITEM"* ]]
#:
#:       i.e. "nslookup www.distrowatch.com" contains "nslookup".
#:       i.e. "apt-file" does not contain "apt " ( "apt"<SPACE> ).
#:       [[ "$MENU_ITEM" == "$MENU_ITEM_NAME "* ]]
#:
#:       Please see function "f_menu_item_valid"
#:       in library module "lib_cli-common.lib."
#:
#: *My QA background also explains this crazy documentation of everything along
#:  with the fact that I am just learning bash scripting.
#:
#:
#: +----------------------------------------+
#: |             Script features            |
#: +----------------------------------------+
#:
#: *Optimized for 80x24 display or 640x480 pixel displays.
#:  Run-time displayed text is no wider than 80-columns across.
#:  Run-time menus are no longer than 16 items for 24 row displays.
#:  Although the game, "Pacman for Console" needs 32 rows minimum to play.
#:
#: *Limited to 4 menu levels below the Main Menu to run any application.
#:
#: *You can get application help by 'man' or '--help' from the menu prompt.
#:
#: *If an application is not installed, the script can install it using package
#:  managers apt, rpm, slackpkg, pacman or for specific apps, download it from
#:  a web site for manual installation.
#:
#: *If an application needs sudo, script will automatically give a sudo option.
#:
#: *Designed for ease of extensibility and menu editing. No menu item numbers,
#:  and no custom pattern matching is required for each menu item added.
#:
#: *Option numbers in menu display are automatically generated.
#:
#: *More fun than just a list of CLI applications!!!

#: |       HOW-TO Add a new menu item       |
#: +----------------------------------------+
#:
#: New category menus are in the file lib_cli-menu-cat.lib.
#: The template to add a new category menu is:     f_menu_cat_sample_template
#: The template to add a new sub-category menu is: f_menu_scat_sample_template
#:
#: New application menus are in the file lib_cli-menu-apps.lib.
#: The template to add a new application menu is:  f_menu_app_sample_template
#:
#: In brief:
#
#: 1. The menu code is contained in functions with example templates. 
#:
#: 2. If you are adding a NEW APPLICATION within an application menu,
#:    a) An application menu can have a **MAXIMUM OF 16** applications.
#:       If you have more, please create a new sub-menu or sub-category menu.
#:       This is to comply with a 80x24 line screen which is standard.
#:    b) decide what row in the menu that you want to place the new menu item.
#:    c) Add the new menu item see below for menu format details.
#:    d) Each Special Menu Option Marker MUST be unique for each menu.
#:
#:    Note: Please see bottom of this document
#:          for a list of Special Menu Item Markers.
#:
#:    e) Create a new case statement for the new item.
#:       There is no need to include an item number in the pattern matching.
#:       It is generated by the program itself by the function f_choice_array
#:       in lib_cli-common.lib.
#:
#:    f) Format of Menu: 
#: <Menu item options> <SPACE> <Special menu item marker> <SPACE> 
#: <Application name> <SPACE> - <SPACE> <Description>.
#:
#: Format of menu item options: 
#: "#f_funct1^f_funct2^f_funct3^Quit-Code^PRESS_KEY^APP_NAME #MXX"
#:
#: Field 1-3 are function fields. f_funct1, f_funct2,and f_funct3.
#: Name of function or the number "1".
#: The number 1 defaults to a standard naming convention for functions.
#: 1="f_<MENU_ITEM_NAME>" lower-case function name.
#:
#: f_funct1 and f_funct2 are called before the display of the Quit Code.
#: f_funct3 is called after the display of the Quit Code.
#:
#: Field 4 is the number of the Quit Code used by f_quit_app_clause.
#: This will display the custom "How to quit" the application message.
#: For a list of Quit Codes, see f_quit_app_clause in file lib_cli-common.lib.
#:
#: Field 5 sets the variable "PRESS_KEY" 1=Displays "Press 'Enter' key" message.
#:       #0^0^0^0^1 #MXX appname  - Description Application1 name.
#:
#:    f) Update the file LIST_APPS by selecting "Configure" THEN "LIST_APPS"
#:       in the Main Menu. LIST_APPS is used by the Main Menu item "List
#:       Applications" to show a list of all applications available whether
#:       the app module is downloaded or not.
#:
#: 3. If you are adding a NEW CATEGORY or SUB-CATEGORY menu, please create them
#:    within the appropriate module file mod_apps-*.lib and please use the
#:    templates for this very purpose available in mod_apps_sample_template.
#:    Template: f_menu_scat_sample_template.
#:
#: 4. If you are creating a NEW MAJOR CATEGORY, create a new corresponding 
#:    module file, mod_apps-*.lib and use template f_menu_scat_sample_template
#:    to create the menu structure. ALSO UPDATE the README file and update the
#:    function f_create_LIST_APPS within lib_cli-common.lib with the name of the
#:    new module file so that the text file LIST_APPS can be re-created.
#:
#: 5. The file LIST_APPS may be automatically updated by copying all the 
#:    mod_apps-*.lib files to the current directory and by selecting
#:    "Configure" then "LIST_APPS" in the Main Menu.
#:
#:
#: +----------------------------------------+
#: |   Trouble-shooting a new menu item     |
#: +----------------------------------------+
#:
#: 1. Some or all of the menu items are missing.
#:
#:    If you copied from a template or another menu, check the Special Menu
#:    Item Markers for consistency.
#:    In the example below, #MXX is before each menu item and in DELIMITER.
#:    Note: DELIMITER has #MXX twice, separating it into 3 fields for awk.
#:
#:            #MXX appname  - Description Application1 name.
#:            #MXX app2name - Description Application2 name.
#:            #
#:            PRESS_KEY=1 # Display "Press 'Enter' key to continue."
#:            MENU_TITLE="<Sample Template> Applications Menu"
#:            DELIMITER="#MXX" #MXX This 3rd field prevents awk from printing this line into menu options.
#:
#: 2. Impossible to exit a menu.
#:
#:    *Somewhere in the mod_apps-*.lib file, there is a syntax error.
#:    "read MXX" may be the wrong variable name, especially if you copied from
#:    the template.
#:
#: 3. Strange menu results, menu does not display.
#:    *If you forget the closing "}" to a function, you'll get strange results.
#:    *If you forget a comment "#" marker i.e. "} End of function", then menu
#:     may not even display.
#:
#: 4. Only a few of the Menu items display when the number or letter is selected.
#:    Check any instance of echo with only a single double-quotation mark.
#:    Change from: echo "I forgot to type in the trailing double-quote.
#:    Change   to: echo "I forgot to type in the trailing double-quote."
#:
#:
#: +----------------------------------------+
#: |     Known problems and limitations     |
#: +----------------------------------------+
#:
#: 1. All associated files for this script must be in the same folder. 
#:
#: 2. f_choice_array needs all menu items to have 1 or 2 unique words in a name
#:    within the same menu.
#:
#:    i.e. Acceptable names for a menu    Unacceptable names for a menu 
#:
#:      WAN Applications Menu          WAN Applications Menu
#:      ip route                       ip route list
#:                                     ip route flush
#:
#: 3. Option for automatic software installation only for distributions which
#:    use apt, rpm, slackpkg, and pacman; all others must install manually.
#:
#: 4. For Slackware-based distros which use slackpkg, even though you can
#:    install software, I have not figured out a way to determine if
#:    "slackpkg install <package name> was successful or not. 
#:    The command results in error code zero $?=0 even if install fails.
#:    As a result, I commented out the code which traps slackpkg installation
#:    errors, shows an error message and asks if you want to download the
#:    source code from the developer's web site.
#:

#: |               For more help            |
#: +----------------------------------------+
#:
#: Please refer to the "Main Menu" of the script.
#:
#: *How to get help on an application is under "Help and Features".
#:
#: *Programming help and notes are under "Documentation" 
#:
#: *There are also example templates to create additional category and app menus
#:  within the script.
