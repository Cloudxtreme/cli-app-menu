#: |            Brief Description           |
#: +----------------------------------------+
#:
#: Script cli-app-menu.sh is a menu of CLI applications and commands
#: to help CLI newbies to discover what a command line can do.
#:
#: File naming convention for archiving:
#: $THIS_FILE_<YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM>.sh
#:
#: +----------------------------------------+
#: | FILE LOCATIONS of cli-app-menu project |
#: +----------------------------------------+
#:
#: Edit history is now documented in a separate file/script 'EDIT_HISTORY'.
#: The files EDIT_HISTORY, COPYING, README must be in the same folder/directory
#: as this file/script so the Main Menu options to view/edit 'Edit History' or
#: to view 'License' can work.
#:
#: +----------------------------------------+
#: |        HOW-TO Update this script       |
#: +----------------------------------------+
#:
#: After each edit made, update the version (date stamp string) of this script
#: in both the EDIT_HISTORY file and this file.
#: Also update the edit history in the EDIT_HISTORY file.
#:
#: +----------------------------------------+
#: |    Revision number and Revision Date   |
#: +----------------------------------------+
#:
#: Calculate revision number by counting all lines starting with "## 2013".
#: grep ^ (carot sign) means grep any lines beginning with "##2013".
#: grep -c means count the lines that match the pattern.
#:
#:REVISION=$(grep ^"## 2013" -c EDIT_HISTORY) ; REVISION="2013.$REVISION"
#:REVDATE="July-03-2013 16:11"
#:
#: +----------------------------------------+
#: |      Why did I write this script?      |
#: +----------------------------------------+
#:
#: I wrote this script for 3 reasons:
#: 1. I wanted a categorized list of command line applications.
#: 2. I wanted to learn bash scripting, i.e. functions, looping, tests.
#: 3. I couldn't find a cli menu to launch cli apps on the web so I thought I'd
#:   give back to the community and perhaps others could build on and improve on
#:   what I've started.
#:
#: Please enjoy . . . bob chin (2013).

#: +----------------------------------------+
#: |      Why is this menu so complex?      |
#: +----------------------------------------+
#:
#: *The menus are designed to be quite extensible and are easily edited.
#: *Menu item choices are added with a simple comment line.
#: *The case pattern statements do not need a manually edited numeric pattern
#:  because menu item choices are numerically matched automatically
#:  by the use of an array generated from the menu item comment lines.
#:
#: Why not use the select command? Why not be a lazier pattern matcher?
#:
#: *I used to be a MUMPS programmer and QA analyst.
#:
#: *I used to create menus in this style in MUMPS and being a QA person, my job
#:  was to try to break programs. So that's why I tried to make pattern matching
#:  so robust rather than use wild-cards.
#:
#: *My QA background also explains this crazy documentation of everything along
#:  with the fact that I am just learning bash scripting.
#:
#:
#: +----------------------------------------+
#: |             Script features            |
#: +----------------------------------------+
#:
#: *Optimized for 80x24 display or 640x480 pixel displays.
#:  Run-time displayed text is no wider than 80-columns across.
#:  Run-time menus are no longer than 17 items for 24 row displays.
#:  Although the game, "Pacman for Console" needs 32 rows minimum to play.
#:
#: *Limited to 4 menu levels below the Main Menu to run any application.
#:
#: *You can get application help by 'man' or '--help' from the menu prompt.
#:
#: *If an application is not installed, script will automatically install it.
#:
#: *If an application needs sudo, script will automatically give a sudo option.
#:
#: *Designed for ease of extensibility and menu editing.
#:
#: *Option numbers in menu display are automatically generated.
#:  (However, case pattern matching are hand-written).
#:
#: *More fun than just a list of CLI applications!!!

#: |       HOW-TO Add a new menu item       |
#: +----------------------------------------+
#:
#: The template to add a new category menu is:     f_menu_cat_sample_template
#: The template to add a new sub-category menu is: f_menu_scat_sample_template
#: The template to add a new application menu is:  f_menu_app_sample_template
#:
#: In brief:
#
#: 1. The menu code is contained in functions before the main program code.
#:    The main program code, "Main Menu" is at the bottom of this listing.
#:
#: 2. If you are adding a new application within an application menu, 
#:    a) decide what row in the menu that you want to place the new menu item.
#:    b) Add the item string: <Special Menu Option Marker beginning with #> 
#:       <name of item> <space><dash><space> <description>
#:    c) Each Special Menu Option Marker MUST be unique for each menu.
#:
#:    Note: Please see bottom of this document
#:          for a list of Special Menu Option Markers.
#:
#:    d) Create a new case statement for the new item.
#:    e) Adjust the case statement patterns of menu items below the new item.
#:       If you added the item in the middle of the menu, all case patterns for
#:       the items below it need to be adjusted.
#:
#:    The case patterns will accept both the menu option number, or all or part
#:    of the menu item name in upper or lower case or any mixture of case.
#:
#: 3. If you are adding a new category or sub-category menu, please use the
#:    templates for this very purpose.
#:    f_menu_cat_sample_template or f_menu_scat_sample_template.
#:
#: 4. If you are adding a new application menu, please use the template for
#:    this very purpose, f_menu_app_sample_template.
#:
#:
#: +----------------------------------------+
#: |   Trouble-shooting a new menu item     |
#: +----------------------------------------+
#:
#: 1. Some or all of the menu items are missing.
#:
#:    If you copied from a template or another menu, check the Special Menu
#:    Option Markers for consistency.
#:    In the example below, #MXX is before each menu item and in DELIMITER.
#:    Note: DELIMITER has #MXX twice, separating it into 3 fields for awk.
#:
#:            #MXX appname  - Description Application1 name.
#:            #MXX app2name - Description Application2 name.
#:            #
#:            PRESS_KEY=1 # Display "Press 'Enter' key to continue."
#:            MENU_TITLE="<Sample Template> Applications Menu"
#:            DELIMITER="#MXX" #MXX This 3rd field prevents awk from printing this line into menu options.
#:
#: 2. Menu items only display when the number is selected, not letters.
#:
#:    Check the case patterns of the letters.
#:    Wrong! [Tt][Ee][Ss][Tt]) or [Tt][Ee][Ss][[Tt]) 
#:    Right! [Tt] | [Tt][Ee] | [Tt][Ee][Ss] | [Tt][Ee][Ss][Tt])
#:
#: 3. Menu items only display when the letters are selected, not the number.
#:    Or Wrong application is run when I select the number.
#:
#:    Check to see that you do not have duplicate numbers or out of sequence
#:    numbers in the case patterns.
#:
#:
#: +----------------------------------------+
#: |            Known problems              |
#: +----------------------------------------+
#:
#: Running the script using DASH used in Ubuntu, Linux Mint and other
#: distributions will cause these errors.
#: cli-app-menu.sh: 388: cli-app-menu.sh: CHOICE[1]=Applications: not found
#: cli-app-menu.sh: 388: cli-app-menu.sh: CHOICE[2]=Help: not found
#: cli-app-menu.sh: 388: cli-app-menu.sh: CHOICE[3]=About: not found
#:
#: Reason: DASH does not handle arrays properly.
#:
#: Work-around: Use BASH instead of DASH. 
#: Use BASH, "bash cli-app-menu.sh" instead of "sh cli-app-menu.sh".
#:
#:
#: +----------------------------------------+
#: |               For more help            |
#: +----------------------------------------+
#:
#: Please refer to the "Main Menu" of the script.
#:
#: *How to get help on an application is under "Help and Features".
#:
#: *Programming help and notes are under "Documentation" 
#:
#: *There are also example templates to create additional category and app menus
#:  within the script.
