#: |            Brief Description           |
#: +----------------------------------------+
#:
#: Script cli-app-menu.sh is a menu of CLI applications and commands
#: to help CLI newbies to discover what a command line can do.
#:
#: Start by downloading cli-app-menu.sh, EDIT_HISTORY, COPYING, README,
#: LIST_APPS, lib_cli-common.lib, and lib_cli-menu-cat.lib.
#:
#: Then download optional modules as needed when you run the script:
#: # bash cli-app-menu.sh
#: You will be asked if you want to download additional modules (files)
#: that contain sub-menus for more CLI applications.
#:
#: Any unneeded module files, mod_apps-*.lib may be deleted at any time.
#:
#: File naming convention for archiving:
#: $THIS_FILE_<YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM>.sh
#:
#:
#: +----------------------------------------+
#: | FILE LOCATIONS of cli-app-menu project |
#: +----------------------------------------+
#:
#: The following files must be in the same folder/directory.
#: cli-app-menu.sh, EDIT_HISTORY, COPYING, README, LIST_APPS,
#: lib_cli-common.lib, and lib_cli-menu-cat.lib.
#: 
#: When cli-app-menu.sh is run i.e. "bash cli-app-menu.sh",
#: then you can download selected module files, "mod_apps-*.lib."
#: The module files contain sub-menus of various applications.
#: A list of applications is in LIST_APPS.
#:
#: You may download all or as few module files as you wish.
#: You may delete any module files that you do not need.
#:
#:
#: +----------------------------------------+
#: |        HOW-TO Update this script       |
#: +----------------------------------------+
#:
#: After each edit made, update the version (date stamp string) of each affected
#: file along with the EDIT_HISTORY file which contains the project rev date.
#: Also update the edit history text in the EDIT_HISTORY file.
#:
#:
#: +----------------------------------------+
#: |    Revision number and Revision Date   |
#: +----------------------------------------+
#:
#: Calculate revision number by counting all lines starting with "## 2013".
#: grep ^ (carot sign) means grep any lines beginning with "##2013".
#: grep -c means count the lines that match the pattern.
#:
#:REVISION=$(grep ^"## 2013" -c EDIT_HISTORY) ; REVISION="2013.$REVISION"
#:REVDATE="August-20-2013 22:40"

#: |      Why did I write this script?      |
#: +----------------------------------------+
#:
#: I wrote this script for 3 reasons:
#: 1. I wanted a categorized list of command line applications.
#: 2. I wanted to learn bash scripting, i.e. functions, looping, tests.
#: 3. I couldn't find a cli menu to launch cli apps on the web so I thought I'd
#:   give back to the community and perhaps others could build on and improve on
#:   what I've started.
#:
#: Please enjoy . . . bob chin (2013).

#:
#: +----------------------------------------+
#: |      Why is this menu so complex?      |
#: +----------------------------------------+
#:
#: *The menus are designed to be quite extensible and are easily edited.
#:
#: *Menu item choices are added with a simple comment line.
#:
#: *The case pattern statements do not need a manually edited numeric pattern
#:  because menu item choices are numerically matched automatically
#:  by the use of an array generated from the menu item comment lines.
#:
#: Why not use the select command? Why not be a lazier pattern matcher?
#:
#: *I used to be a MUMPS programmer and QA analyst.
#:
#: *I used to create menus in this style in MUMPS and being a QA person, my job
#:  was to try to break programs. So that's why I tried to make pattern matching
#:  so robust rather than use wild-cards.
#:
#:       Update: Wildcards are now used to help reduce the size of the script.
#:
#: *My QA background also explains this crazy documentation of everything along
#:  with the fact that I am just learning bash scripting.
#:
#:
#: +----------------------------------------+
#: |             Script features            |
#: +----------------------------------------+
#:
#: *Optimized for 80x24 display or 640x480 pixel displays.
#:  Run-time displayed text is no wider than 80-columns across.
#:  Run-time menus are no longer than 17 items for 24 row displays.
#:  Although the game, "Pacman for Console" needs 32 rows minimum to play.
#:
#: *Limited to 4 menu levels below the Main Menu to run any application.
#:
#: *You can get application help by 'man' or '--help' from the menu prompt.
#:
#: *If an application is not installed, the script can install it using package
#:  managers apt, rpm, slackpkg, pacman or for specific apps, download it from
#:  a web site for manual installation.
#:
#: *If an application needs sudo, script will automatically give a sudo option.
#:
#: *Designed for ease of extensibility and menu editing.
#:
#: *Option numbers in menu display are automatically generated.
#:  (However, case pattern matching are hand-written).
#:
#: *More fun than just a list of CLI applications!!!

#: |       HOW-TO Add a new menu item       |
#: +----------------------------------------+
#:
#: New category menus are in the file lib_cli-menu-cat.lib.
#: The template to add a new category menu is:     f_menu_cat_sample_template
#: The template to add a new sub-category menu is: f_menu_scat_sample_template
#:
#: New application menus are in the file lib_cli-menu-apps.lib.
#: The template to add a new application menu is:  f_menu_app_sample_template
#:
#: In brief:
#
#: 1. The menu code is contained in functions with example templates. 
#:
#: 2. If you are adding a NEW APPLICATION within an application menu, 
#:    a) decide what row in the menu that you want to place the new menu item.
#:    b) Add the item string: <Special Menu Option Marker beginning with #> 
#:       <name of item> <space><dash><space> <description>
#:    c) Each Special Menu Option Marker MUST be unique for each menu.
#:
#:    Note: Please see bottom of this document
#:          for a list of Special Menu Item Markers.
#:
#:    d) Create a new case statement for the new item.
#:       There is no need to include an item number in the pattern matching.
#:       It is generated by the program itself by the function f_choice_array
#:       in lib_cli-common.lib.
#:    e) Edit the file LIST_APPS to add the new menu item manually.
#:       LIST_APPS is used by the Main Menu item "List Applications" to show
#:       a list of all applications available whether the app module is
#:       downloaded or not.
#:
#: 3. If you are adding a NEW CATEGORY or SUB-CATEGORY menu, please create them
#:    within the appropriate module file mod_apps-*.lib and please use the
#:    templates for this very purpose available in mod_apps_sample_template.
#:    Templates: f_menu_scat_sample_template or f_menu_tcat_sample_template.
#:
#: 4. If you are creating a NEW MAJOR CATEGORY, create a new corresponding 
#:    module file, mod_apps-*.lib and use template f_menu_scat_sample_template
#:    to create the menu structure. ALSO UPDATE the README file and update the
#:    function f_create_LIST_APPS within lib_cli-common.lib with the name of the
#:    new module file so that the text file LIST_APPS can be re-created.
#:
#:
#: +----------------------------------------+
#: |   Trouble-shooting a new menu item     |
#: +----------------------------------------+
#:
#: 1. Some or all of the menu items are missing.
#:
#:    If you copied from a template or another menu, check the Special Menu
#:    Item Markers for consistency.
#:    In the example below, #MXX is before each menu item and in DELIMITER.
#:    Note: DELIMITER has #MXX twice, separating it into 3 fields for awk.
#:
#:            #MXX appname  - Description Application1 name.
#:            #MXX app2name - Description Application2 name.
#:            #
#:            PRESS_KEY=1 # Display "Press 'Enter' key to continue."
#:            MENU_TITLE="<Sample Template> Applications Menu"
#:            DELIMITER="#MXX" #MXX This 3rd field prevents awk from printing this line into menu options.
#:
#: 2. Menu items only display when the number is selected, not letters.
#:
#:    Check the case patterns of the letters.
#:    Wrong! [Tt][Ee][Ss][Tt]) or [Tt][Ee][Ss][[Tt]) 
#:    Right! [Tt] | [Tt][Ee] | [Tt][Ee][Ss] | [Tt][Ee][Ss][Tt])
#:
#: 3. Only a few of the Menu items display when the number or letter is selected.
#:    Check any instance of echo with only a single double-quotation mark.
#:    Change from: echo "I forgot to type in the trailing double-quote.
#:    Change   to: echo "I forgot to type in the trailing double-quote."
#:
#:
#: +----------------------------------------+
#: |     Known problems and limitations     |
#: +----------------------------------------+
#:
#: 1. All associated files for this script must be in the same folder. 
#:
#: 2. f_choice_array needs all menu items to have 1 or 2 unique words in a name
#:    within the same menu.
#:
#:    i.e. Acceptable names for a menu    Unacceptable names for a menu 
#:
#:      LAN/WAN Applications Menu      LAN/WAN Applications Menu
#:      ip link                        ip route list
#:      ip route                       ip route flush
#:
#: 3. Option for automatic software installation only for distributions which
#:    use apt, rpm, slackpkg, and pacman; all others must install manually.
#:
#: 4. For Slackware-based distros which use slackpkg, even though you can
#:    install software, I have not figured out a way to determine if
#:    "slackpkg install <package name> was successful or not. 
#:    The command results in error code zero $?=0 even if install fails.
#:    As a result, I commented out the code which traps slackpkg installation
#:    errors, shows an error message and asks if you want to download the
#:    source code from the developer's web site.

#: |               For more help            |
#: +----------------------------------------+
#:
#: Please refer to the "Main Menu" of the script.
#:
#: *How to get help on an application is under "Help and Features".
#:
#: *Programming help and notes are under "Documentation" 
#:
#: *There are also example templates to create additional category and app menus
#:  within the script.
