#: |      Why did I write this script?      |
#: +----------------------------------------+
#:
#: I wrote this script for 3 reasons:
#: 1. I wanted a categorized list of command line applications.
#: 2. I wanted to learn bash scripting, i.e. functions, looping, tests.
#: 3. I couldn't find a cli menu to launch cli apps on the web so I thought I'd
#:   give back to the community and perhaps others could build on and improve on
#:   what I've started.
#:
#: Please enjoy . . . bob chin (2013).

#: |      Why is this menu so complex?      |
#: +----------------------------------------+
#:
#: Why not use the select command? Why not be a lazier pattern matcher?
#:
#: *I used to be a MUMPS programmer and QA analyst.
#:
#: *I used to create menus in this style in MUMPS and being a QA person, my job
#:  was to try to break programs. So that's why I tried to make pattern matching
#:  so robust rather than use wild-cards.
#:
#: *My QA background also explains this crazy documentation of everything along
#:  with the fact that I am just learning bash scripting.

#: |             Script features            |
#: +----------------------------------------+
#:
#: *Optimized for 80x24 display or 640x480 pixel displays.
#:  Run-time displayed text is no wider than 80-columns across.
#:  Run-time menus are no longer than 17 items for 24 row displays.
#:  Although the game, "Pacman for Console" needs 32 rows minimum to play.
#:
#: *Limited to 3 menu levels below the Main Menu to run any application.
#:
#: *You can get application help by 'man' or '--help' from the menu prompt.
#:
#: *If an application is not installed, script will automatically install it.
#:
#: *If an application needs sudo, script will automatically give a sudo option.
#:
#: *Designed for ease of extensibility and menu editing.
#:
#: *Option numbers in menu display are automatically generated.
#:  (However, case pattern matching including option numbers are hand-written).
#:
#: *More fun than just a list of CLI applications!!!
