## 2015-01-24 *Release version 2.0 "Dorothy".
##            *Added 34 new applications since 1.2.1 "Carol".
##            *New functionality, Main Menu added "Favorites" to display a
##             "Favorite Application Menu" and ability to add applications
##             to that menu by using any application menu.
##            *New functionality, "Find and Run" an application from the
##             Main Menu rather than just from the application menus.
##            *New functionality, "List or Find Menus" from the Main Menu.
##            *New functionality, test internet connection before downloading
##             new applications or modules or before updating the modules.
##            *New functionality, when "Update program" is chosen, after a
##             successful update occurs, then program will exit to the shell,
##             forcing user to use the updated program.
##            *Changed functionality, web install runs only if automatic install
##             fails and custom install either fails or does not exist.
##            *Main Menu re-ordered menu item options.
##            *Bug fixed if updating program/modules without an Internet
##             connection, files would be deleted (to make room for new ones).
##             Now if updating program/modules without an Internet connection,
##             user is notified and files are unaffected and not deleted.
